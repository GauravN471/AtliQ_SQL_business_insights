# AtliQ Hardwares – SQL Business Insights (FY2020–2021)

This project analyzes AtliQ Hardwares’ sales, products, customers and channels using SQL to generate executive-level business insights.

## Business Objective
To help senior management make data-driven decisions on:
- Product portfolio expansion
- Channel strategy
- Customer discount risk
- Seasonal demand planning
- Cost and margin exposure

## Business Questions Answered
The analysis covers 10 real management questions including:
- Which markets Atliq Exclusive operates in

- Segment-wise SKU expansion
- High and low manufacturing cost products
- Customers receiving the highest discounts
- Monthly and quarterly demand patterns

- Top-selling products by division

## Tools Used
- MySQL (CTEs, joins, window functions, aggregations)
- SQL
- PowerPoint (executive presentation)

## Key Insights
- Retailer channel contributes ~73% of FY2021 revenue, creating concentration risk  
- Q4 alone drives ~41% of annual demand, requiring seasonally optimized operations  
- A few SKUs drive most volume across divisions, making forecasting accuracy critical  
- High-cost products combined with high customer discounts create margin pressure  

## Repository Structure
- `/sql_queries` – All SQL scripts used to answer business questions  
- `/presentation` – Final executive presentation (PDF/PPT)  
- `/data` – Database or data files  

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be translated into strategic business insights for senior management using SQL.
